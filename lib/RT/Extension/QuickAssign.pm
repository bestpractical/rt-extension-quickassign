=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-QuickAssign - Add owner change links on ticket display page

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For tickets that are currently unowned, this extension provides an
"Assign..." menu under the Actions menu, allowing users with sufficient
rights to quickly assign the owner to any of the possible owners for a
ticket.

Generating the list of potential owners for a ticket may have a
performance impact for some installations.
